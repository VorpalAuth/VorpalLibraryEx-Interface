# VorpalLibraryEx-Interface
A set of guidelines to interact with the VorpalLibraryEx and your application, defined in C but language-agnostic. 

You should only use this if you want to interface with the Vorpal Extended Library from a language that doesn't already have a wrapper around this interface such as [[C++](https://github.com/VorpalAuth/VorpalLibraryEx-CPP)].
